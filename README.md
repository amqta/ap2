# AP2 - Algorithms and Programming II

Welcome to the AP2 repository! This repository contains the C codes developed during the "Algoritmos e Programação II" classes.

Building upon the concepts from AP1, this course delves into more advanced C programming topics, including:

* **Structs:** Introduction to creating and using structs for organizing related data of different types (Lab 01). Working with arrays of structs and nested structs (Lab 02).
* **Scope and Functions:** Understanding the difference between global and local variables and their scope. Creating and using basic functions (Lab 03).
* **Modular Programming:** Utilizing header files (`.h`) and multiple source files (`.c`) for better code organization and reusability (as seen starting from Lab 04).
* **Recursion:** Exploring recursive functions to solve problems like factorials, Fibonacci sequence, GCD, and number/string manipulations (Lab 05).
* **Pointers:** Understanding and applying pointers, including pointer arithmetic, passing parameters by reference, and using pointers with arrays and structs (Labs 06 and 07).
* **File Handling:** Performing operations on files, such as creating, writing, reading, renaming, and deleting text and data files (Lab 08).

Feel free to explore the laboratory exercises (`labXX/exYY`) to see the implementation of these concepts.
